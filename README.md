# Teaching Demos

This repository contains interactive web demonstrations for teaching signal processing and machine learning concepts.

## Available Demos

### 1. Fourier Transform Demonstration (`fourier-demo.html`)
An interactive visualization of the Fourier Transform principles. This demo helps students understand how different signals can be decomposed into their frequency components through visual representation.

### 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Simulator (`rag-html-simple.html`)
A simple simulator that demonstrates the concept of embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation in natural language processing. This tool helps visualize how semantic similarity works in vector spaces for information retrieval.

### 3. Poles, Zeros and Fourier Transform (`poles-zeros-fourier.html`)
An interactive demonstration showing the relationship between poles, zeros, and the Fourier Transform in signal processing. This visualization helps students understand how the placement of poles and zeros affects frequency response.
