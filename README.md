# Teaching Demos

This repository contains interactive web demonstrations for teaching signal processing and machine learning concepts.

## Available Demos

### 1. Fourier Transform Demonstration (`fourier-demo.html`)
An interactive visualization of the Fourier Transform principles. This demo helps students understand how different signals can be decomposed into their frequency components through visual representation.

**Live Demo**: [https://cjescudero.github.io/teachingdemos/fourier-demo.html](https://cjescudero.github.io/teachingdemos/fourier-demo.html)

### 2. Poles, Zeros and Fourier Transform (`poles-zeros-fourier.html`)
An interactive demonstration showing the relationship between poles, zeros, and the Fourier Transform in signal processing. This visualization helps students understand how the placement of poles and zeros affects frequency response.

**Live Demo**: [https://cjescudero.github.io/teachingdemos/poles-zeros-fourier.html](https://cjescudero.github.io/teachingdemos/poles-zeros-fourier.html)

### 3. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Simulator (`rag-html-simple.html`)
A simple simulator that demonstrates the concept of embeddings and retrieval-augmented generation in natural language processing. This tool helps visualize how semantic similarity works in vector spaces for information retrieval.

## Usage

These demos are standalone HTML files that can be opened directly in any modern web browser. No server or additional installation is required.

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/teachingdemos.git
   ```

2. Open any of the HTML files in your web browser to start using the demonstrations.

3. Interacting with the demos:
   - **Fourier Transform Demo**: Use the sliders to adjust frequency components and observe how they affect the composite signal. Click on the graph to add custom points.
   - **RAG Simulator**: Enter text in the input field to see how embeddings are generated and how similar documents are retrieved based on semantic similarity.
   - **Poles and Zeros Demo**: Drag poles and zeros on the complex plane to see how they affect the frequency response in real-time.

4. For optimal performance:
   - Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
   - Enable JavaScript in your browser settings
   - For the best experience, view on a desktop or laptop computer with a screen width of at least 1024px

## Online Access

All demos are also available online through GitHub Pages. You can access them directly using the links in the "Available Demos" section above without needing to download or clone the repository.
